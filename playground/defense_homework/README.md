This reporsitory is for defense homework.

Please revise the `tasks/defense_homework/defense_homework.py` file to complete the task.

You can use the following commands to evaluate the result:
`python Evaluator.py`

Basically, the original accuracy of the adversarial examples are around `40%` and the goal of the homework is to make the accuracy of the adv examples to `90%` on the 1000 test data points.

The defense model wil be saved under `models/defense_homework-model.pth`.

**Important change:** For submission on Gradescope, you will have to submit both the trained model (the pth file) as well as your py code. Your submission should be a zip file called `defense_homework_{ucinetid}.zip`, containing 2 files: `defense_homework.py` and `defense_homework-model.pth`.
